# typewriter-sort
A sorting algorithm has a time complexity of $`O(n)`$ and in the worst case, it has a time complexity of $`O( \infty )`$.
Yes, it's worse than Bogosort, Bozosort and Bogobogosort.
The algorithm was made as a joke in order to be the worst algorithm of all time.
The usage of two ```python while``` loops makes it impossible to give the desired output in time.
